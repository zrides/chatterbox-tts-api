# Test Suite Migration Guide

This guide explains the migration from the old standalone test scripts to the new pytest-based comprehensive testing suite.

## 🔄 What Changed

### Before (Old System)

- Individual Python scripts (`test_api.py`, `test_memory.py`, etc.)
- Direct `requests` calls in each script
- Manual test execution with `if __name__ == "__main__"`
- No shared configuration or utilities
- Limited error handling and reporting
- No test categorization or markers

### After (New System)

- Pytest-based framework with shared fixtures
- Centralized configuration in `conftest.py`
- Comprehensive test runner (`run_tests.py`)
- Test categorization with markers
- Coverage reporting and HTML outputs
- CI/CD integration ready
- Makefile for common operations

## 🔧 Migration for Existing Tests

### Old Way (Before)

```bash
# Run individual test scripts
python tests/test_api.py
python tests/test_memory.py
python tests/test_regression.py
```

### New Way (After)

```bash
# Run quick tests
make test

# Run all tests
make test-all

# Run specific category
make test-api
make test-memory
make test-regression

# Or use the test runner directly
python tests/run_tests.py --quick
python tests/run_tests.py --all
python tests/run_tests.py --api-only
```

## 🧪 Test Structure Migration

### Old Structure

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests

API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:4123"

def test_health_check():
    """Test the health check endpoint"""
    response = requests.get(f"{API_BASE_URL}/health")
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("✓ Health check passed")
        return True
    else:
        print("✗ Health check failed")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_health_check()
```

### New Structure

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import pytest
from conftest import generate_speech_and_validate

class TestHealthEndpoints:
    """Test health and basic endpoint functionality"""

    def test_health_check(self, api_client):
        """Test the health check endpoint"""
        response = api_client.get("/health")
        assert response.status_code == 200

        data = response.json()
        assert "status" in data
```

## 🔄 Converting Remaining Files

The following files still need conversion to the new pytest format:

### `test_status.py`

- Convert print statements to assertions
- Use pytest fixtures for API client
- Add test markers (`@pytest.mark.api`)
- Organize into test classes

### `test_voice_library.py`

- Convert to pytest structure
- Use shared voice sample fixture
- Add cleanup fixtures for test voices
- Add test markers (`@pytest.mark.voice`)

### `test_voice_upload.py`

- Convert to pytest structure
- Use shared fixtures for file uploads
- Add proper test organization
- Add test markers (`@pytest.mark.voice`)

## ⚡ Performance Improvements

| Aspect              | Old System      | New System         | Improvement  |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |

   make test-coverage
   ```

4. **Run specific category:**

   ```bash
   make test-api     # API tests only
   make test-memory  # Memory tests only
   ```

5. **Generate HTML report:**
   ```bash
   make test-html
   open test_report.html
   ```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Old way
python tests/test_api.py  # Runs entire file

# New way
pytest tests/test_api.py::TestHealthEndpoints::test_health_check  # Specific test
pytest tests/test_api.py::TestHealthEndpoints  # Specific class
pytest -k "health"  # By keyword
pytest -m "api"     # By marker
```

### Debugging Tests

```bash
# Old way
# Add print statements and run script

# New way
pytest -v -s tests/test_api.py  # Verbose output
pytest --pdb tests/test_api.py  # Drop into debugger on failure
pytest -x tests/test_api.py     # Stop on first failure
```

### Parallel Execution

```bash
# Old way
# Not supported

# New way
python tests/run_tests.py --parallel
pytest -n auto
```
